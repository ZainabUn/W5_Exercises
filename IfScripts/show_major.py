#  Create a script named show_major.py that defines two variables for a student: 
# student_name and student_major. The student_major variable will contain a 
# code for the student’s major (e.g. ENG). 
# 2. Use the following table to create lookup logic to display the name of the major and 
# location of the department’s office based on the major code:

# What should your program do if a major code is not included in the table? Include an 
# alternative to display <unknown> for the major name and nothing for location. 
# 3. Run the script several times with different test values for student name and major 
# code. (Make sure to include at least one test with a made-up major code not included 
# in the table!)
