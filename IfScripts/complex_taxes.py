# Create a script named complex_taxes.py that will calculate federal tax based on the 
# values of annual gross income (a number) and a filing status (‘single’ or ‘joint’). 
# 2. Start by copying your code for calculation of gross pay from the earlier lab 
# (pay_rules.py) and include it here as part of your starting point. Remember, that code 
# calculates weekly gross pay. Extend that calculation to estimate annual gross pay 
# (how many weeks in a year?) and save it to a new variable. 
# 3. Use a series of if statements to determine the appropriate tax rate. 
# The tax table for single filers is: 
# The tax table for joint filers is: 
# 4. Use the tax rate to determine the tax withheld from the weekly gross pay.  
# 5. Create separate print statements to print the relevant information determined by the 
# above calculations. The output of your script might look something like this: 
# You worked __ hours this period. 
# Because you earn $___ per hour, your gross weekly pay is $475

# Your filing status is ___ 
# Your tax withholding for the week is $___ 
# Your net pay is $___  
# 6. To properly test the code, you will need to run it multiple times using different values 
# for hours worked, pay rate, and filing status. Examine the tax tables and see if you can 
# determine a set of good test values. Discuss with your small group – then run your 
# tests!
